## ‚ú® 0.4.2

- #### ü§ï Fixes

  - **recognize `[dependencies.wasm-bindgen]` during dep check in `init` - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/221] [pull/224]**

    When we originally implemented the dependency check in `wasm-pack init` we naively only checked for the
    "simple" dependency declaration, `[dependencies] wasm-bindgen="0.2"`. However! This is not the only way
    to declare this dependency, and it's not the ideal way to do it if you want to specify features from the
    crate. Now that a bunch of folks want to use `features = ["serde-serialize"]` we ran into a bunch of folks
    having issues with our naive dependency checker! Thanks so much to [turboladen] for filing the very detailed
    issue that helped us solve this quickly!

    PSSSST! Curious what `features = ["serde-serialize"]` with `wasm-bindgen` actually does? It's awesome:

    > It's possible to pass data from Rust to JS not explicitly supported in the [Feature Reference](./feature-reference.md) by serializing via [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).

    Read the [Passing arbitrary data to JS docs] to learn more!

    [pull/224]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/224

  - **improve UX of publish and pack commands - [Mackiovello], [pull/198]**

    Previous to this fix, you would need to be in the parent directory of the `/pkg` dir to successfully run
    `pack` or `publish`. This was pretty crummy! Thankfully, [Mackiovello] swooped in with a fix, that you can
    find documented in the [pack and publish docs]!

  - **use `PathBuf` instead of `String` for paths - [Mackiovello], [pull/220]**

    This is mostly a maintenance PR  but does fix one very small bug- depending on if you add a trailing slash to
    a path that you pass to `init`, you might have seen an extra `/`! Now that we're using a proper Type to
    handle this, that's much better, and in general, all the operations using paths are more robust now.

- #### üìñ Documentation

  - **update docs and tests to eliminate no longer necessary feature flags - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/226]**

    The Rust 2018 edition marches on and we are seeing feature flags drop like flies :) Instead of a whole slew
    of feature flags, we now only need one, `#![feature(use_extern_macros)]`, and that one is also not long for
    this world :)

## ‚≠ê 0.4.1

- #### ü§ï Fixes

  - **fix `files` key value for projects build for `nodejs` target - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/199] [pull/205]**

    We became aware that the `files` key in `package.json` did not include the additional `_bg.js` file that 
    `wasm-bindgen` generates for projects being built for the `nodejs` target. This resulted in the file not
    being included in the published package and resulted in a `Module Not Found` error for folks.

    This was a group effort from [mciantyre] with [pull/200] and [Brooooooklyn] with [pull/197]. Thank you so
    much for your diligence and patience while we sorted through it.

- #### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

  - **clean up `quicli` remnants - [SoryRawyer], [pull/193]**

    In [v0.3.0] we removed the `quicli` dependency, however there were a few remnants
    left behind. They are now removed!

- #### üìñ Documentation

  - **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!! and deny missing docs for all future development - [fitzgen], [pull/208]**

    The `wasm-pack` team has worked hard on tutorial documentation and keeping the codebase as self-explanatory
    as possible, but we have been slowly accruing a documentation debt. This amazing PR, landed just moments
    before this point release and was just too good not to include. Thank you so much, [fitzgen]!

    [fitzgen]: https://github.com/fitzgen
    [pull/208]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/208

  - **fix README code example - [steveklabnik], [pull/195]**

    The code example in our `README.md` was missing a critical `pub`. It's there now!

    [pull/195]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/195/files

  - **fix README markup - [Hywan], [pull/202]**

## üåü 0.4.0

This release has a ton of awesome things in it, but the best thing is that
almost all of this awesome work is brought to you by a **new** contributor
to `wasm-pack`. Welcome ya'll! We're so glad to have you!

### ‚ú® Features

- #### üéè New Flags

  - **`--mode` flag for skipping steps when calling `init` - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/186]** 

      After teaching and working with `wasm-pack` for some time, it's clear that people would
      like the flexibility to run some of the steps included in the `init` command and not others.
      This release introduces a `--mode` flag that you can pass to `init`. The two modes currently
      available are `skip-build` and `no-installs` and they are explained below. In the future, 
      we are looking to change the `init` interface, and potentially to split it into two commands.
      If you have thoughts or opinions on this, please weigh in on [issue/188]!

      [issue/188]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/issues/188
      [pull/186]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/186

    - **`skip-build` mode - [kohensu], [pull/151]**

      ```
      wasm-pack init --mode skip-build
      ```

      Sometimes you want to run some of the shorter meta-data steps that
      `wasm-pack init` does for you without all the longer build steps. Now
      you can! Additionally, this PR was a fantastic refactor that allows even
      more custom build configurations will be simple to implement!

      [kohensu]: https://github.com/kohensu
      [pull/151]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/151

    - **`no-installs` mode - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/186]**

      ```
      wasm-pack init --mode no-installs
      ```

      Sometimes you want to run `wasm-pack` and not have it modify your global
      env by installing stuff! Or maybe you are just in a hurry and trust your
      env is set up correctly- now the `--mode no-install` option allows you to
      do this.

  - **`--debug`  - [clanehin], [pull/127]**

    ```
    wasm-pack init --debug
    ```

    Find yourself needing to compile your Rust in `development` mode? You can now
    pass the `--debug` flag to do so! Thanks so much to [clanehin] for filing 
    [issue/126] for this feature... and then implementing it!

- #### ‚úÖ New Checks

  - **ensure you have `cdylib` crate type - [kendromelon], [pull/150]**

    One of the biggest mistakes we've seen beginners make is forgetting to declare
    the `cdylib` crate type in their `Cargo.toml` before running `wasm-pack init`.
    This PR fixes that, and comes from someone who ran into this exact issue learning
    about `wasm-pack` at [JSConfEU]! Love when it works out like this.

    [kendromelon]: https://github.com/kedromelon
    [pull/150]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/150

  - **ensure you have declared wasm-bindgen as a dep - [robertohuertasm], [pull/162]**

    Another easy mistake to make is to forget to declare `wasm-bindgen` as a
    dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. Now `wasm-pack` will check and make sure you
    have it set before doing a bunch of long build steps :)

    [robertohuertasm]: https://github.com/robertohuertasm
    [pull/162]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/162

  - **ensure you are running `nightly` - [FreeMasen], [pull/172]**

    `wasm-pack` currently requires that you run it with `nightly` Rust. Now, `wasm-pack`
    will make sure you have `nightly` installed and will ensure that `cargo build` is run
    with `nightly`. Thanks so much to [FreeMasen] for filing [issue/171] and fixing it!

    [issue/171]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/issues/171
    [pull/172]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/172

### ü§ï Fixes

- **fixed broken progress bar spinner - [migerh], [pull/164]**

  Oh no! We broke the progress bar spinner in version 0.3.0. Thankfully, it's
  fixed now- with a thoughtful refactor that also makes the underlying code
  sounder overall.

[migerh]: https://github.com/migerh
[pull/164]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/164

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

- **WIP bot - [ashleygwilliams] & [mgattozzi], [issue/170]**

  We've got a lot of work happening on `wasm-pack` so it's good to have a bit
  of protection from accidentally merging a Work In Progress. As a result, we
  now have the [WIP Github App] set up on `wasm-pack`. Great suggestion [mgattozzi]!

  [WIP Github App]: https://github.com/wip/app
  [issue/170]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/issues/170

- **modularize `command.rs` - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/182]**

  Thanks to the growth of `wasm-pack`, `command.rs` was getting pretty long.
  We've broken it out into per command modules now, to help make it easier to
  read and maintain!

  [pull/182]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/182

- **improve PoisonError conversion - [migerh], [pull/187]**

  As part of the awesome progress bar spinner fix in [pull/164], [migerh] introduced
  a small concern with an `unwrap` due to an outstanding need to convert `PoisonError`
  into `wasm-pack`'s custom `Error`. Though not a critical concern, [migerh] mitigated
  this right away by replacing `std::sync::RwLock` with the [`parking_lot` crate]!
  This cleaned up the code even more than the previous patch!

  [`parking_lot` crate]: https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot
  [pull/187]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/187

- **wasm category for crates.io discovery- [TomasHubelbauer], [pull/149]**

  [crates.io] has [categories] to help folks discover crates, be we weren't
  leveraging it! Now- if you explore the [`wasm` category] on [crates.io]
  you'll see `wasm-pack`!

### üìñ Documentation

- **cleaned up the README - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/155]**

  Our `README` was struggling with a common problem- doing too much at once.
  More specifically, it wasn't clear who the audience was, contributers or 
  end users? We've cleaned up our README and created a document specifically
  to help contributors get up and running.

[pull/155]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/155

## üå† 0.3.1

Babby's first point release! Are we a real project now?

### ü§ï Fixes 

- **fixed `init` `Is a Directory` error - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/139]**

  Our new logging feature accidentally introduced a regression into 0.3.0. When
  calling `wasm-pack init`, if a directory was not passed, a user would receive
  a "Is a Directory" Error. Sorry about that! Thanks to [jbolila] for filing 
  [issue/136]!

- **typescript files were not included in published package - [danreeves], [pull/138]**

  Generating Typescript type files by default was a pretty rad feature in
  0.3.0 but we accidentally forgot to ensure they were included in the 
  published package. Thanks so much to [danreeves] for catching this issue 
  and fixing it for us!

[danreeves]: https://github.com/danreeves
[pull/138]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/138

## üí´ 0.3.0

### ‚ú® Features

- **Logging - [mgattozzi], [pull/134]**

  Up until now, we've forced folks to rely on emoji-jammed console output to debug
  errors. While emojis are fun, this is often not the most pleasant experience. Now
  we'll generate a `wasm-pack.log` file if `wasm-pack` errors on you, and you can
  customize the log verbosity using the (previously unimplemented) verbosity flag.

[pull/134]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/134

- **`--target` flag - [djfarly], [pull/132]**

  `wasm-bindgen-cli` is able to generate a JS module wrapper for generated wasm files
  for both ES6 modules and CommonJS. Up until now, we only used wasm-bindgen's default
  behavior, ES6 modules. You can now pass a `--target` flag with either `nodejs` or 
  `browser` to generate the type of module you want to use. Defaults to `browser` if not
  passed.

[djfarly]: https://github.com/djfarly
[pull/132]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/132

- **human readable panics - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/118]**

  Panics aren't always the most friendly situation ever. While we never want to panic on ya,
  if we do- we'll do it in a way that's a little more readable now.

[pull/118]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/118

- **typescript support by default - [kwonoj], [pull/109]**

  `wasm-bindgen` now generates typescript type files by default. To suppress generating
  the type file you can pass the `--no-typescript` flag. The type file is useful for more
  than just typescript folks- many IDEs use it for completion!

[kwonoj]: https://github.com/kwonoj
[pull/109]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/109

- **wrap `npm login` command - [djfarly], [pull/100]**

  In order to publish a package to npm, you need to be logged in. You can now use
  `wasm-pack login` to login to the npm (or any other) registry.

[pull/100]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/100

- **exit early on failure - [mgattozzi], [pull/90]**

  Until now, `wasm-pack` would continue to run tasks, even if a task failed. Now- if something
  fails, we'll exit so you don't have to wait to fix the error.

[pull/90]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/90

### ü§ï Fixes

- **force install wasm-bindgen - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/133]**

  Using an out of date version of `wasm-bindgen` can run you into a bunch of trouble. This
  very small change should fix the large number of bug reports we received from users using
  an out of date `wasm-bindgen-cli` by force installing `wasm-bindgen-cli` to ensure the user
  always has the latest version. We don't expect this to be a forever solution (it's a bit
  slow!) but it should help those who are getting started have a less rough time.

[pull/133]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/133

- **fix CI release builds - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/135]**

  This was not working! But now it is! You can always use `cargo install` to install
  wasm-pack, but now you can find pre-built Linux and Mac binaries in the [Releases]
  tab of our GitHub repo.

### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance 

- **remove `quicli` dependency - [mgattozzi], [pull/131]**

  While `quicli` is a great way to get started writing a CLI app in Rust- it's not meant for 
  large, mature applications. Now that `wasm-pack` is bigger and has many active users, we've
  removed this dependency to unblock further development on the tool.

[pull/131]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/131

- **update rustfmt CI test - [djfarly], [pull/128]**

  Since 0.2.0 how one should call `rustfmt` changed! We've kept it up to date so we can continue
  to maintain conventional style in the codebase.

[pull/128]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/128

- **custom module for errors - [mgattozzi], [pull/120]**

  Thanks to the `failure` crate, we've been playing fast and loose with errors for a bit. We're
  finally getting serious about error handling - by organizing all of our specific errors in a
  specific module. This will make it easier to communicate these errors out and handle new error
  cases from future features.

[pull/120]: https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack/pull/120

### üìñ Documentation

Special thanks to [data-pup] who continues to be our documentation champion! In case you missed it,
check out the guides in the [docs directory!](docs)!

## üåå 0.2.0

This release focuses on filling out all commands and improving stderr/out
handling for improved user experience!

### ‚ú® Features

- **`pack` and `publish` - [jamiebuilds], [pull/67]**
  You can now run `wasm-pack pack` to generate a tarball of your generated package,
  as well as run `wasm-pack publish` to publish your package to the npm registry.
  Both commands require that you have npm installed, and the `publish` command requires
  that you be logged in to the npm client. We're working on wrapping the `npm login`
  command so that you can also login directly from `wasm-pack`, see [pull/100] for more
  details.

- **`package.json` is pretty printed now - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  Previously, `package.json` was not very human readable. Now it is pretty printed!

- **`collaborators` - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  `wasm-pack` now will fill out the `collaborators` field in your `package.json` for
  you based on your `Cargo.toml` `authors` data. For more discussion on how we decided
  on this v.s. other types of `author` fields in `package.json`, see [issues/2].
